## About Me

Hello and nice to meet you.  
I'm currently working in an administrative role in Tokyo, and I enjoy spending my free time casually exploring social media.

I have a fondness for soft vinyl toys and video games—ranging from nostalgic classics to more recent releases.  
I'm not a serious collector, but I do enjoy picking up items that catch my eye and browsing through related content online.

Sometimes I take a walk around Akihabara. I don't usually have a specific goal, but I love looking at figures, retro games, and wandering through the shops.  
Although I’m not a fan of crowds, there’s something about the atmosphere that keeps drawing me back.

I’m not the type to post frequently, but every now and then I might share something that catches my interest.  
Overall, I just like taking things at my own pace and quietly enjoying what I love.

If we share any common interests or you feel we’d get along, feel free to follow or reach out.  
Thanks for stopping by!
